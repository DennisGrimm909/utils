# Pure JavaScript program to read aircraft positions via WebUSB

This project reads the ADS-B signals from nearby airplanes and plots the positions in Google Maps

You need a [suitable USB Device and antenna](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&linkCode=as2&tag=wa7son-20&linkId=ae47931667148dc42699cd9c9705422e)

The antenna should be mounted vertically and total length should be around 13cm (6.5cm each for top and bottom parts)

On Windows you need to use [zadig to install a driver](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tag/zadig/) so that the device can be accessed from Chrome using WebUSB
